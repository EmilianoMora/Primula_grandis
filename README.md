# *Primula grandis*
This github project contains scripts to perform all the analyses and plots for [Mora-Carrera et al. (2025) Genomic patterns of loss of distyly and polyploidization in primroses](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf162).

All necessary file to perfom downstream analyses including the reference genome, genome annotation and filtered VCF files can be found in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Evolutionary_history_of_i_Primula_grandis_i_/28540910)
